## UFOs

In this project I used JavaScript, bootstrap, CSS Style sheets in order to create a webpage that ha dynamic tables of UFO sighting data. Using the webpage, users can filter the data using criteria in order to see results dynamically. 

The Resources used included:

 - Data Source: data.js
 - Software: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, D3, and E6+

## #1 Overview of the Project:

The purpose of this analsis was to build an HTML page that allows uses to find information for the city, state, country, shape, and date through the table filters that were created using JavaScript and HTML.

## #2 Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Someone may use the new webpage by searching for UFO activity within a certain state. For instance, let's say an end user was looking for all UFO activity in the state of MA in United States, they could select the filter for state: "MA" and country: "USA" to return the following results with specific information per the user request.

By design, this website is intuitive to use and similar to other websites and filtering available in say, travel booking websites like Hotwire, or when searching for items on a Target website using specific filters.

In order to create a new search, the user can Refresh the page or clear their previous selections. 

Another potential search could be by dates. Let's say a user is looking for information on all UFO sightings for the date of 1/2/2010, they would search using the following criteria that would render the following results:

## #3 Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
